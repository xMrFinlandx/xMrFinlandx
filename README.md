<h1 align='center'>Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ivan Frolov, a C# developer</h1>


I've been developing desktop applications since 2019, starting with C# for working with databases in Windows Forms and WPF. In 2020, I also started learning Unity for game development and continue to do so. My main goal is to further my career in IT and secure a position in a prestigious company in the future.
